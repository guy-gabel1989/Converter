# Converter
This is my first Java project, Part of QA automation course.
It's a currency converter that takes static values of USD (US dollar) and ILS (Israeli new Shekel) and helps the user to covert the two to whatever amount they want.

Submitted to my teacher Danial Gotlib from QA Experts academy
